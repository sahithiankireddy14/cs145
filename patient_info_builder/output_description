For each patient, we create structure in the following way:
Patient Info Dictionary:
- patient age
- race
- gender
- age of death

Patient Admissions Dictionary:
- diagnosis [list of diagnoses]
- hcpcs events [sorted list of procedures, where each procedure is a dictionary (procedures with no given order are placed randomly at the end)] 
    - [{procedure 1 details}, {procedure 2 details}, {procedure 3 details}]
    - {procedure 1 details} -> {"actual short description" : "", "official short description of encoded procedure": "", "official long description of encoded procedure": "", "sequence number": ""}
- diagnosis related group
    - [{drg 1 details}, {drg 2 details}, {drg 3 details}]
    - {drg 1 details} -> {"type": "", "description": "", "severity": ""}
